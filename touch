Steps to setup 4 node ansible setup

# Setup this on the master node
1- # Install epel 8
install Epel 8 release yum install epel-release

2- # Install ansible 2.8
yum install ansible

3- #check ansible version and config path
ansible --version


#Setup 4 nodes (Slave Server)- CentOS or Ubuntu
webserver-1
webserver-2
dbserver-1
dbserver-2

#Steps to Configure ansible
1-  Launch Managed/Slave/Mode Servers
2-  Managed Nodes needs python 2 upward
3-  Ansible will use SSH connection to managed nodes using passord-less authentication with SSH Keys
4- Provide the IP address or FQDN of the managed nodes in the inventory file on Ansible master node/Engine
5- Simple test the setting vy using    "ansible all -m ping" command



# Create password-less authentication
# create same users across all servers and use same password for all servers. ( both master nodes and managed nodes)
useradd ansadmin
passwd ansadmin

# Provide ROOT privileges to ansadmin user on all servers
 visudo 
ansadmin        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD:  ALL

# Make sure password authentication YES is in all servers in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
type : vi /etc/ssh/sshd_confile
# after password authentication YES
#restart the sshd service
service sshd restart


# Generate SSH Keys using ssh-keygen command from ansadmin user
# login to ansadmin 
# Type.  ssh-keygen 

#CD into the ssh folder
type cd /etc/ssh

# copy ssh public key using ssh-copy-id  <hostname> (of the managed nodes). from the /home/ansadmin/.ssh/location


# Update inventory file on Ansible master node/Engine. with managed nodes ip addresses.
to modify the host inventory file, cd into the cd /etc/ansible/


# Simple test the setting by using    "ansible all -m ping" command
